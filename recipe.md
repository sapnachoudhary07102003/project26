Making the dabeli masala:-
1: Dry roast the red chili, cumin, cloves, cinnamon and coriander seeds. You cannot see the coriander seeds as I have used my homemade roasted coriander powder while grinding the masala.
2: add all the ingredients in a dry grinder.
3: Grind to a fine powder. You will have some powder left even after adding it to dabeli. You can use it in some veggies or rice recipes.

Making chutney:-
1: Soak the red chilies in warm water for 30-40 mins. In a wet grinder add the soaked red chilies, garlic, lemon juice.
2: Grind to a smooth paste. Add water if required while grinding. Keep this red garlic chutney aside.

Making potato filling for dabeli:-
1: Boil the potatoes in a pressure cooker or microwave oven. Peel and mash them and keep aside. Don’t have a pic of this one. In a pan or kadai, heat oil. Add cumin. Then add chopped onion. Fry the onions till they become soft.
2: Add asafoetida (hing) and fry for a minute on a low flame.
3: Add the tamarind dates chutney to the onions and mix well.
4: Add the mashed potatoes and again mix well.
5: Add the dabeli masala powder to the mashed potatoes.
6: Mix well and add salt.
7: Cook for 2-3 minutes stirring the mixture. If the mixture looks a little dry then add 1 or 2 tbsp of water. I did not have to add any water to the potato mixture.
8: When done, spread the potato filling on a plate….. Not sure why it is looking so orangish… I guess me playing with the camera settings has resulted in such a weird photo…..
9: Sprinkle some grated coconut on the potato filling.
10: Add some chopped coriander.
11: Now add pomegranate seeds or grapes or both. I did not have grapes at home.

Frying the slices of bread:--
1: While all of the above was happening my wheat flour buns were ready and hot from the oven.
2: Slice the bun or pav into two. On a tava or griddle, melt some butter and lightly roast the buns or pav in butter. Keep aside.

Making dabeli:--
1: Assemble all the ingredients required for making dabeli in one place. The pic below says it all.
2: Apply the sweet chutney on one slice of the bun and the red garlic chutney on the other side.
3: Take a slice of the prepared potato filling and put it on top of one of the slices of bread. This one has a little extra of the coriander leaves.
4: Add some chopped onion and coriander.
5: Top it up with some roasted peanuts and pomegranate seeds. Sprinkle some dabeli masala also.
6: The last topping is of sev. You can also roll the stuffed buns in the sev.
7: Cover with the other slice of bread. in the same way make all the dabeli pav and serve these beautiful, yummy and gorgeous street food snack to your loved ones.
